# Open Issues

## Known / Candidate Improvements
- Frontend `page.tsx` is very large and should be split into smaller components/hooks.
- Add stronger frontend accessibility pass (focus states, labels, keyboard flow, ARIA polish).
- Add tests around frontend payload construction to prevent request drift.
- Expand backend regression suite for more toggle-interaction edge cases.

## Process Note
- This file should list unresolved items only.
- Move completed items into `HANDOFF.md` with date.
- No duplicate entries; merge by topic and update in place.
